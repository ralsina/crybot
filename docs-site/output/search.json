What is MCP? MCP is an open standard for AI applications to connect to external tools and data sources. Think of it as a universal plugin system. Configuring MCP Servers Edit ~/.crybot/config.yml : mcp: servers: - name: filesystem command: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/allow - name: playwright command: npx @playwright/mcp@latest Available MCP Servers Popular MCP servers: @playwright/mcp - Browser automation @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem - File operations @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search - Web search @modelcontextprotocol/server-github - GitHub integration @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres - PostgreSQL database Find more at github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers Using MCP Tools Once configured, tools are automatically available: You: Read the file /home/user/document.txt\nCrybot: [Uses filesystem/read_file] File content: ... Tool Names MCP tools are prefixed with the server name: filesystem/read_file playwright/browser_navigate brave-search/web_search Management via Web UI Navigate to MCP Servers section to: View configured servers Add new servers (name + command) Remove servers Reload configuration Environment Variables Some MCP servers require environment variables: mcp: servers: - name: github command: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github env: GITHUB_TOKEN: \"your_token\" Troubleshooting If an MCP server fails to connect: Check the server command is correct Verify required environment variables Check server logs in Crybot output Some servers may require specific dependencies MCP servers run in stdio mode, which means Crybot starts each server as a subprocess and communicates via standard input/output. ← Scheduled Tasks Built-in Tools →","url":"/books/user-guide/10-mcp.html","id":20},{"title":"Crybot: 11 Built-in Tools","text":"Home » Books » Crybot User Guide » Built-in Tools Crybot User Guide » 1 Installation 2 Configuration 3 Features Overview 4 Web Interface 5 REPL Mode 6 Voice Mode 7 Telegram Integration 8 Skills System 9 Scheduled Tasks 10 MCP Integration 11 Built-in Tools 12 Advanced Topics Crybot includes a comprehensive set of built-in tools for various operations. File Operations read_file Read the contents of a file. read_file(path=\"/path/to/file.txt\") write_file Write or create a file with content. write_file(path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", content=\"Hello, World!\") edit_file Edit a file using find and replace. edit_file(path=\"/path/to/file.txt\", find=\"old\", replace=\"new\") list_dir List directory contents. list_dir(path=\"/path/to/directory\") System & Web exec Execute shell commands. exec(command=\"ls -la\") web_search Search the web using Brave Search API. web_search(query=\"Crystal programming language\") web_fetch Fetch and read web pages. web_fetch(url=\"https://example.com\") Memory Management save_memory Save important information to long-term memory. save_memory(information=\"Crystal is a programming language\") Saved to ~/.crybot/workspace/MEMORY.md . search_memory Search long-term memory and daily logs. search_memory(query=\"Crystal language features\") list_recent_memories List recent memory entries from daily logs. list_recent_memories(days=7) record_memory Record events or observations to the daily log. record_memory(note=\"Implemented new feature today\") memory_stats Get statistics about memory usage. memory_stats() Skill Creation create_skill Create a new skill from the conversation. create_skill(name=\"my-skill\", description=\"Does X\") create_web_scraper_skill Create a web scraping skill. create_web_scraper_skill(url=\"https://example.com\", name=\"scraper\") Tool Execution Display When tools are executed, Crybot displays: Tool name and arguments Execution status (success/error) Output or error message Duration (in some interfaces) Adding Custom Tools Custom tools can be added in src/agent/tools/ as Crystal classes extending the Tool base class. See the source code for examples of how tools are implemented. ← MCP Integration Advanced Topics →","url":"/books/user-guide/11-tools.html","id":21},{"title":"Crybot: 12 Advanced Topics","text":"Home » Books » Crybot User Guide » Advanced Topics Crybot User Guide » 1 Installation 2 Configuration 3 Features Overview 4 Web Interface 5 REPL Mode 6 Voice Mode 7 Telegram Integration 8 Skills System 9 Scheduled Tasks 10 MCP Integration 11 Built-in Tools 12 Advanced Topics This chapter covers advanced usage and customization. Hot Config Reload Crybot automatically reloads ~/.crybot/config.yml on changes. No restart needed! This works for:\n- API keys\n- Model selection\n- Feature toggles\n- MCP server configuration\n- Telegram settings Session Management Session Keys Sessions follow the pattern: {channel}:{identifier} Examples:\n- web:68d4ec74b8359478b3ccdc9a9b6ad740 - telegram:57433113 - voice: - repl: - scheduled/daily-summary Session Storage Sessions are stored in ~/.crybot/sessions/ as JSONL files: {\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Hello\"}\n{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Hi there!\"} Custom Templates Crybot uses Crinja templates (Jinja-like) for prompts. Customize in ~/.crybot/workspace/ : AGENTS.md - Agent behavior USER.md - User persona TOOLS.md - Tool descriptions SOUL.md - Core personality Debugging Verbose Mode Set verbosity in config.yml : # 0: fatal, 1: errors, 2: warnings, 3: info, 4: debug, 5: trace\nverbosity: 4 Logs Check logs for:\n- MCP connection issues\n- Tool execution failures\n- Feature startup problems Performance Incremental Builds Crybot only rebuilds what changes - sessions load only their own history. Fiber-based Concurrency Features run in separate fibers for efficient concurrent operation.
